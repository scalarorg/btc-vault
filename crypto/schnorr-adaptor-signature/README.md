# schnorr-adaptor-signature

This package provides an implementation of the Schnorr adaptor signature in Golang.
It follows the construction in paper [One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures](https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/tree/master).
The implementation strictly ports the Rust implementation in [secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/adaptor/mod.rs).
